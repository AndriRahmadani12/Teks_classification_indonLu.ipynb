# Text Classification with IndonLU Dataset Using TF-IDF and Machine Learning

## Introduction

Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text into predefined categories. In this project, I utilized the IndonLU dataset and employed TF-IDF vectorization along with various machine learning algorithms to perform text classification.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to develop a text classification model capable of accurately categorizing Indonesian text data. The IndoLU (Indonesian Language Understanding) dataset was used, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was applied for text vectorization. Various machine learning models were then trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.

## Dataset

The IndonLU dataset contains a collection of Indonesian texts labeled with different categories. It is a comprehensive dataset that provides a robust foundation for developing and testing text classification models.
